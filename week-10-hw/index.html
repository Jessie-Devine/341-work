    <p class=large-head>Responsive Web Design</p>
    <div class="block">
        <p class=mini-head>What is it, anyway?</p>
        <p class=block-text>Responsive web design is a type of web design that responds to users' behaviors, particularly size of the device with which they access the internet. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="block">
        <p class="mini-head">How the heck does that work?</p>
        <p class=block-text>Read on, my friend.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="skinny">
        <p class=mini-head>All of that, but mainly this:</p>
        <p class=skinny-text>See how this page is sort of grid-shaped? Gridding out a web layout really helps RWD be effective. Content is placed within individual containers, which are then free to move around the screen when it is resized. The grid doesn't have to be perfectly grid-like, either. As you can see, parts of this grid are blocks, some parts are tall and skinny, and others are short and fat. What's important is each piece of the grid being able to jump around and resize independently when needed.<br /><br />
        The great thing about this is that content <i>within</i> individual containers also gets pushed around so it stays legible. Try resizing. See how the text moves to fit inside the container? This is only possible with RWD grids.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="block">
        <p class=mini-head>Float</p>
        <p class="block-text">One reason RWD works is the <i>float</i> tag. Float lets objects sit next to each other. For example, these black boxes are floating left, while our violet friend over here is floating right.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="block">
        <p class=mini-head>Relative Sizes</p>
        <p class=block-text>Absolute sizes don't work very well for RWD. Sizes instead need to be rendered in percentages, as in, percentages of screen space. It won't work for an object to be 1500px if your screen is half that size.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="block">
        <p class=mini-head>Margins</p>
        <p class=block-text>It is also helpful for margins to be relative. These black boxes have 5% margins on the right and left and 3% margins on the bottom. For the same reason relative sizes are better for RWD, relative margins work better than absolute margins.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="block">
        <p class=mini-head>Design</p>
        <p class=block-text>Design is also important for RWD. Each object should stand on its own, and stand out from the background. Additionally, the design should always be user-friendly and make sense, no matter what size the screen.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="squat">
        <p class=mini-head>GO AHEAD. RESIZE YOUR SCREEN.</p>
    </div>

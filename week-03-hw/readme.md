This homework cycle, I struggled less. HTML makes sense to me, and I found the instructions clearer to follow. I am learning how to use GitHub desktop, and I didn't struggle with this like I did in the last couple weeks. I focused on the following things:

- following instructions exactly step-by-step
- doing the readings more than once
- setting out enough time for myself to make mistakes and not panic

##Stuff that is awesome

Some really great things happened for me this week in this class. They are:

1. I realized the class is building on itself, and this is helping me feel grounded.
2. Because of 1, I realize I'm able to go back to previous lessons and remind myself of stuff I don't quite get.
3. I'm feeling less frustrated and more able to sort out problems.
4. I am starting to enjoy this class for real!


##Stuff I need to work on

1. Getting into the issues forum. I've not been doing well at this. I still don't feel like I have a lot to contribute.
2. Readme files. I'm still not positive what the point of them is. I understand that I'm writing one now, but what do other people use them for?
3. Time management. Still.

##Conclusion

I'm pretty pumped to keep working in HTML for a while. Is that what we're doing? I hope we are.

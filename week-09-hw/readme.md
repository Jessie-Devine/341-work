# Jessie Devine - MART 341, Week 9

This week I struggled to create the dropdown menu I wanted. I wanted to create a horizontal menu (where the dropdown <i>options</i> are horizontal, not the top level) and I found one way to make it, but it disrupted all the rest of my formatting. I ended up creating the dropdown and then adding normal links because I couldn't sort out any other way to do it. But it works!

My color palette is meant to match the background image; the koi fish. I sampled colors from it to create a fun, bright color palette. Then I used lighter, softer colors in the side panel because I wanted them to fade more into the background and draw less attention.

For my typography, I chose a font that looked elegant but approachable, which suits the brand I was trying to create. Additionally, I used the small-caps variant on the links to separate them from the rest of the content.

I'm really proud of this project this week.

# Jessie Devine - MART 341, Week 11

This week I was overwhelmed with the prospect of starting a parallax website from scratch, and the things I tried in the beginning didn't work. I think I didn't have the proper class-within-a-class thing going. I wasn't understanding how to place div classes within each other for some reason--I've done this before, but this week it would not work. My blocks kept appearing all over the place, and I got frustrated.

I scratched all of that and started over using some of the example code from this week's lesson as my bedrock. I then adapted the different containers to fit my needs.

I used the caption class to create bold, light blue lines in the design and to create depth. I also split the border class into several so I could have animated GIFs running in each background. I also adjusted padding, font, spacing, margin, and content in all the different classes to create a simple (and cute!) website about bulldogs.

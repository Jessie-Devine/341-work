# Jessie Devine - MART 341, Week 8
I had a lot of fun writing the story this week. I included a few animated GIFs and overall had a good time with this assignment. I put a ton of effort into it, and I'm really pleased with how it turned out. A few things I noted:

1. Using stylesheets is so much easier than changing every single thing individually.
2. I used tables to format everything, and I'm not sure if there's an easier/better way that I missed or haven't learned yet.

3. I LOVE all the names of the CSS colors! They're adorable. I mean, come on. Firebrick? Peachpuff? üòç

# Jessie Devine - MART 341, Week 6

I was behind this week, but when I finally finished the homework, I liked what I came up with. I like bubbly drinks, so I wrote a whole page about carbonation. ðŸ˜‚ My favorite part is my landing page, the index.html page.

I used Photoshop to create some of the images I used. That was pretty fun. The piece I struggled with the most was the contact/map page. I couldn't figure out how to format the bubbles with the map and all the different pieces and make it look decent. I still feel pretty meh about that page, even though I like the rest.

I also was really pleased with my youtube hosted video, because I figured out how to have the video autoplay <i>and</i> start at a certain point in the video. I didn't like the beginning of the video I chose, so this was really helpful.
